# Boston Bluebikes Conversion Campaign Incentives Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to increase subscription revenue stability for Boston Bluebikes through targeted conversion campaigns. By understanding user behavior patterns and identifying characteristics of subscription customers, we aim to recommend pricing changes and incentives to drive subscription rates. This analysis leverages historical data from 2016 to 2019 to identify user segmentation, optimize pricing structures, and measure the long-term impact of conversion campaigns on subscription retention.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to enhance the overall user experience, increase subscription rates, and create a more stable and sustainable revenue stream for Boston Bluebikes. By understanding and influencing rider preferences, we aim to contribute to the financial success of the bike-sharing service. Key objectives include identifying patterns distinguishing subscription customers from one-time riders, optimizing pricing structures, designing effective conversion campaigns, and measuring the long-term impact on subscription retention.

## Data
The primary data source is the GA PostgreSQL database for Boston Bluebikes spanning from 2016 to 2019. This dataset contains information on bike rides, including start and end stations, user type, duration, and timestamps. Insights derived from this dataset will inform station popularity, utilization patterns, ride behaviors, user segmentation, and subscription duration. Secondary data sources may be considered to supplement the analysis.

## Analysis
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for this analysis include:
- Conversion Rate: Percentage of one-time riders who convert to subscription.
- Subscriber Engagement: Average duration of rides for subscribers and non-subscribers before and after conversion campaigns.
- Retention Rate: Subscriber retention rates over time to measure the long-term impact of conversion campaigns.
- Demographic Response: Variation in conversion rates among different age and income groups, if demographic data is available.

Additional analyses will focus on tailoring campaigns to target demographic segments, understanding the impact of campaigns on increased usage among subscribers, and making assumptions about the dataset's accuracy and limitations regarding external factors influencing conversion rates.

## Deliverables
1. Analysis Report: Detailed findings and insights from the data analysis process.
2. Recommendations: Pricing changes, incentive strategies, and campaign designs to drive subscription rates.
3. Visualizations: Charts, graphs, and dashboards to illustrate key insights.
4. Documentation: Descriptions of methodologies, assumptions, limitations, and data sources used in the analysis.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, we aim to provide actionable recommendations to increase subscription revenue stability and ensure the sustainability of Boston Bluebikes. By understanding user behavior and designing targeted conversion campaigns, we can enhance the user experience and contribute to the financial success of the bike-sharing service.
